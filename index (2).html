<div>

<h2 class="beggining">The Beginning</h2>

<p class="beggining">Aurelius Augustinus Hipponensis better known as St. Augustine was born in 354, in Thagaste, North Africa to a christian mother and a pagan father who actually converted to christianity on his deathbed <br>  His family ancestery likely included latins, berbers, and phoenecians.  He considored himself to be a punic.  His family name of Aurelius suggests his fathr's ancestors were freedmen of
the group Aurelia, given full roman citizenship by the Edict of Caracalla in 212.  By the time of Augustine's birth his famiyl had likely been Roman for at least a century.  His family were honestiores, upperclass of Roman Citizens known as honorable men (The family had repect but likely not wealth).  As a result he recieved the best education and his first language was probably latin.  
Auguetine showed early promise in school so his parents sent him to Madaurus at the age of eleven for education where he provent himself extremly intelligent.  He recalled his home life as happy and his school life less so.

<h2 class="badboy">Badboy Phase</h2>

<p class="badboy">St. Augustine went through a little bit of a rebellious phase in his youth, <br>actually a very rebellious phase which extended into adulthood.  His indiscretions were so abundant that after he saw the error in his way he managed to fill a book of confessions with the disgusting details of his behavior which most people might considor TMI.  Whatever your flaws he was probanly worse.

<h2 class="conversion">Conversion</h2>

<p class="conversion">
    Up to this point Augustine had always considored christianty lacking in logic but Bishop Andrews of Milan convinced him otherwise.   His skilled oration together with his helping Augustine to understand christianity in a new light caused Augustine to make a break with Mechanism his previous belief and considor christianity.  In fall of 386 he had a conversion experience and withdrew with a group of like minded friends for the winter to an isolated place.  That whole winter they discussed the faith and on easter of next year he was baptized by Bishop Ambrose.
